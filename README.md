# Stackmat #

Library created by mixing https://github.com/stilesdev/stackmat and stackmatsignalprocessor from https://github.com/Kubiverse/StackmatSignalProcessor converted to typescript
Thanks for this 2 great projects

Work with my QiYi timer.

Subscribe to events received from a Stackmat timer connected to the browser via the HTML5 Audio API.

Both a Typescript-based library and a UMD build are available.


## Typescript Usage ##


Subscribe to events and start listening for packets:

```typescript
import { Stackmat, Packet } from 'stackmat'

const stackmat = new Stackmat()

stackmat.on('started', (packet: Packet) => {
    console.log('Timer started')
})


stackmat.start()
```


## Browser Usage ##

Import the UMD build:

Subscribe to events and start listening for packets:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
const stackmat = new Stackmat();

stackmat.on('started', packet => {
    console.log('Timer started')
})

 
stackmat.start()
</script>
```


## Disconnecting ##

`stackmat.stop()` may be called to stop listening for packets, without unsubscribing from any events.

`stackmat.off(TimerEvent?)` may be called to unsubscribe from a specified event, or all events if no specific event is provided.

## Events ##

| `TimerEvent` | When Fired
| --- | ---
| packetRecieved | Every time a valid packet is recieved
| timerConnected | Valid packets start being received
| timerDisconnected | Valid packets stop being received
| started | A solve is started, and the timer starts counting up from zero
| stopped | A solve is completed, and the timer is stopped
| reset | The timer is reset to zero
| ready | Both hands are placed on the timer while the timer is in a reset state
| unready | One or both hands are removed before the green light turns on and the timer is in a ready state
| starting | The green light turns on while in a ready state, indicating the solve can be started
| leftHandDown | The left hand is placed on the timer while the timer is in any state
| leftHandUp | The left hand is removed from the timer while the timer is in any state
| rightHandDown | The right hand is placed on the timer while the timer is in any state
| rightHandUp | The right hand is removed from the timer while the timer is in any state


## Packet Interface ##

Each event callback (with the exception of `timerConnected` and `timerDisconnected`) sends a `Packet` with the following properties:

```typescript
interface Packet {
    isValid: boolean
    status: PacketStatus
    timeInMilliseconds: number 
    isLeftHandDown: boolean
    isRightHandDown: boolean
    areBothHandsDown: boolean
}

```

`PacketStatus` is an enum representing the internal code sent with each Stackmat packet:

```typescript
enum PacketStatus {
    IDLE = 'I',
    STARTING = 'A',
    RUNNING = ' ',
    STOPPED = 'S',
    LEFT_HAND = 'L',
    RIGHT_HAND = 'R',
    BOTH_HANDS = 'C',
    INVALID = 'X',
}
```
